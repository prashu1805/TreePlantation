    <h1>Week -5 Report (From 10-06-24 to 15-06-24)</h1>
    <p><strong>Objective of the Activity Done:</strong> Visit APGENCO and its surroundings</p>
    <p><strong>Detailed Report:</strong> I visited APGENCO and asked permission to conduct a survey but we didn’t get approval from the management of APGENCO. I decided to survey the surroundings to observe the condition of the atmosphere.</p>
